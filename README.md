# wirecard-undo-manager
UndoManager is a small, self-contained example sub-system.

It consists of a couple of interfaces that all play together to fulfill 
the task of tracking, undoing and redoing changes to some text document. 
You can think of it as a sub-system of a text editor.

The task is to understand the interfaces and what role they play in the
UndoManager context and then, based on this understanding, write
implementations of ONLY the UndoManager and UndoManagerFactory interfaces.
